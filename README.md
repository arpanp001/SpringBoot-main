# SpringBoot-main
A collection of projects developed with Spring Boot for the course "Programming for Enterprise Application Development," focusing on database connectivity, CRUD operations, and essential Spring features.

## Overview of Spring Core and Spring JDBC Projects

This repository contains two separate projects aimed at exploring core concepts of Spring and Spring JDBC in Java. Each folder offers practical implementations and insights into various Spring functionalities.

---

### Project 1: **SpringCore1**

This project provides an in-depth look at the core capabilities of the Spring Framework, including dependency injection, bean management, and other foundational concepts. The project is organized into the following packages:

#### Key Packages:
- **Autowiring**: Demonstrates Spring's autowiring feature, which automatically injects dependencies into beans.
- **Annotation**: Utilizes Spring annotations for bean and dependency configuration.
- **Expression Language (SpEL)**: Shows the usage of Spring Expression Language (SpEL) for embedding dynamic expressions in Spring beans.
- **Standalone Collection**: Demonstrates the use of collections (List, Set, Map) in Spring bean configuration.
- **Stereotype**: Explores Spring stereotypes (`@Component`, `@Repository`, `@Service`, `@Controller`) for component management within a Spring application.
- **Simple Spring Core**: A basic demonstration of Spring Core concepts, including bean creation and dependency injection.
- **Constructor Injection**: Explains dependency injection through constructors within Spring beans.
- **Spring Core Lifecycle**: Explores the lifecycle of Spring beans, including initialization and destruction callbacks.

### Project 2: **SpringJdbc2**

This project showcases database integration using Spring JDBC, highlighting how Java applications can connect and interact with relational databases through Spring's JDBC module.

#### Core Features:
- **Java Database Connectivity**: Establishes and manages connections to a relational database using Spring JDBC.
- **DAO (Data Access Object) Pattern**: Implements the DAO pattern to separate data access from business logic.
- **Entity Classes**: Models the database schema as Java classes that represent data entities.

#### Key Components:
- **Database Configuration**: Contains setup files for establishing database connections (e.g., `DataSource` configurations).
- **DAO Layer**: Manages data access logic using `JdbcTemplate` and related classes to execute SQL queries.
- **Entity Classes**: Represents database data as Java objects, with fields mapping to database columns.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Database**: Ensure that the required database setup is complete for the Spring JDBC project.

3. **Run SpringCore1 Modules**:
   - Import the project into a Spring-compatible IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
   - Configure necessary dependencies (Spring, JDBC, etc.).
   - Run individual modules as needed to explore Spring Core concepts.

4. **Run SpringJdbc2**:
   - Ensure the database is properly configured and the schema is created.
   - Run the project to test DAO operations (such as Insert, Update, Delete, and Fetch).

## Dependencies

- **Java**: Version 8 or higher
- **Spring Framework**: Core, JDBC modules
- **Database**: MySQL or any relational database for Spring JDBC
- **Build Tool**: Maven or Gradle for dependency management
